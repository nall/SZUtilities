NSURLConnection is very useful, but it can buffer data coming in from the 
network and this can be undesirable in some applications.  SZURLConnection
is meant to be a drop-in replacement for basic NSURLConnection functionality.
It supports a similar delegate methodology to NSURLConnection.

Limitations:
SZURLConnection does not support caching or authorization delegate methods.
